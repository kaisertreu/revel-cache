## Revel Cache

First and foremost, It's my hobby project with determination to improve this indefinitely in mind.

Revel Cache is about recording manga and manhwa that I read and some occassional manhua and comics. I know there are already existing websites like mine although I don't know about them specifically since there's a quote from the olden times "if you think about it, it probably exist already" but I want to make something like this to also broaden my horizon on programming as an aspiring full stack dev.
